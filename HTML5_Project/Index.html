                        Paul Murray’s fourth novel is about the eeriness of transformative change. 
                        Its more than six hundred pages employ a rotating structure: 
                        the four members of the Barnes family—twelve-year-old PJ, his sister Cass,
                        and his parents Imelda and Dickie—take turns as narrator. 
                        Irony, both caustic and elegiac, flourishes in the knowledge gaps between characters. 
                        Again and again, details come back reframed or reanimated by another perspective. 
                        It’s hard to resist Murray in his schoolyard mode, wittily choreographing nerds and 
                        bullies. The chapters featuring Imelda and Dickie are thornier, more treacherous, 
                        and formally more ambitious, using stream of consciousness to invoke the shattering 
                        power of grief and lust. Murray is interested in denial and how it ultimately fails 
                        to contain our unruly attachments and weird desperation. The catastrophic price of 
                        such denial is evident in the book’s frequent allusions to the climate crisis. 
                        As the book continues, the Earth’s climate and the apocalyptic climate of 
                        the Barnes family appear almost to merge, and what began as a coming-of-age saga
                        pulls in stranger and darker forces.

                     <figcaption>by Catherine Lacey you can find it in Amazoin </figcaption>
                     <p>In this intricate, metafictional novel, a recently widowed writer embarks on a biography 
                        of her late wife, an enigmatic artist, author, and musician known only as X. As the writer 
                        delves deeper into X’s life and work—distinguished by X’s penchant for adopting Cindy Shermanesque 
                        personae—Lacey unfolds a startling counter-history, in which the United States has just reunified,
                        having dissolved, after the Second World War, into three states: one liberal, one libertarian, 
                        and one theocratic. Throughout, Lacey artfully blends historical anecdotes—X is seen penning songs
                        for David Bowie and attending openings with Richard Serra—into her fictional universe, 
                        making uncomfortable connections between X’s fragile world and our own.</p>

                        Mira Bunting is the twenty-nine-year-old founder of Birnam Wood, 
                        an activist collective, in New Zealand, that illegally plants gardens 
                        on unused land. One day, while trespassing on a large farm, she stumbles 
                        upon Robert Lemoine, a billionaire drone manufacturer who offers to finance 
                        the group. In fact, Lemoine has his own agenda—he’s purchasing the farm in secret, 
                        in order to extract rare-earth minerals that will make him the richest man in history—but 
                        this is just the first of the novel’s many sleights of hand. The story, which initially 
                        appears to be a study of young, white leftists grappling with the ethics of taking Lemoine’s money,
                        evolves into a shocking tale of deceit, misunderstanding, and violence. Catton,
                        who became the youngest winner of the Booker for her previous novel, “The Luminaries,”
                        wants to revive plot as a literary mode, and her book’s biggest twist is that every 
                        choice matters, albeit in ways we might not have anticipated.

                     <p>
                        In this moving memoir, Andrew Leland recounts his journey from sight to blindness, 
                        tracing his ever-shifting relationship to his diminishing vision. 
                        Suspended between the worlds of blindness and sight—he will soon lose his vision 
                        entirely—Leland explores the history and culture of blindness: its intersections with medicine, 
                        technology, ableism. He travels to a residential school for the blind, 
                        where he dons shades that block his vision, and learns to cook meals and cross streets. 
                        One former student tells him, “Until you get profoundly lost, and know it’s within you to get unlost, 
                        you’re not trained—until you know it’s not an emergency but a magnificent puzzle.” 
                        The book was excerpted on <a href="newyorker.com">newyorker.com</a>.

                     <figcaption>by Nathan Thrall you can find it in Amazoin </figcaption>
                     <p>
                        In 2012, a catastrophic traffic collision in Jerusalem left a school bus filled 
                        with Palestinian children on fire for more than thirty minutes before emergency workers arrived. 
                        In this chronicle of the disaster, Thrall, a Jerusalem-based journalist, 
                        follows the father of one of the victims, and examines the response 
                        to the crash within the context of modern Palestinian dispossession. 
                        He depicts Israel’s “architecture of segregation”—encompassing checkpoints and byzantine transit 
                        rules—which needlessly complicated the rescue, leading to a delay that 
                        left “small, scorched backpacks” on the asphalt. Thrall’s account is a powerful evocation of a two-tiered 
                        society that treats children as potential combatants.
